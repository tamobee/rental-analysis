# San Francisco Rental Prices Dashboard

My panel dashboard has 4 tabs: Welcome, Yearly Market Analysis, Neighborhood Analysis and Parallel Plots Analysis. 

Welcome tab display an interactive neighborhood map of San Francisco, California from 2010 to 2016. To understand the average sale price per square foot and gross rent, we navigate using pan, zoom, toggle and other navigation tools. The second tab features market analysis of average housing units, average gross rent and average sale price per square foot in San Francisco. The Neighborhood Analysis tab shows average sale price per square foot or each neighborhood. Parallel Plots Analysis tab shows the relationship between average sale price, housing units and gross rent based on neighborhood.
